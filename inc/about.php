                I almost forgot to write who I am. As of today (29.07.2025), I am a Computer Engineering student. I'm 20 years old, and as you can probably tell, 
                I like old-school stuff like this simple website written in PHP without any frameworks and running on Apache HTTP Server. 
                Honestly, I hate the design of modern pages â€” it has no soul. But this! Just look at this! :D

                What do I like? I have a few hobbies: climbing, reading, playing video games, learning languages (I know Ukrainian, English, Polish, <s>russian</s>, 
                and a little bit of German), and of course, hitting the gym. I'm a strong woman! I like to repair things; when something breaks, I am the one who
                will try to fix it until late at night. Also, I drive a car.
